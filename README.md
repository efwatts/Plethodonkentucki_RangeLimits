## Methods <br />
This repository is organized with scripts used to analyse the data used in this manuscript. These subtitles are in accordance with the subtitles used in the Materials and Methods in the manuscript. <br />
### Sampling, DNA Extraction, ddRAD, and Data Filtering

### Ecological Niche Modeling <br />
Includes the ODMAP protocol and the script we used to apply 'SDMTune' to parameterize our models. <br />

### Popultation Genetic Structure <br />
Includes the script used to apply 'tess3r' and sNMF using 'LEA,' the script used to apply 'conStruct,' the DAPC script, and the script employing the R package 'poppr' to quantify genetic variation.

### Isolation by Distance and Isolation by Environment <br />
Contains the R scripts used to apply 'BEDASSLE' and apply the multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR).

### Gene Flow and Effective Population Size <br />
Contains the parm files for the east and west clusters and the scripts used to call MIGRATE-N.
